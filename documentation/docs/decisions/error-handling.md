## New error handling

#### November 1, 2021

As part of the [error handling](https://vault.shopify.io/projects/21713) project we have revised what errors are sent to `errorHandler` callback which users use to report errors to their bug reporting dashboard. You can read more about the motivation and changes in the [tech doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/187H20Jxc5S_e_ZAKtYgYCI6w4biC1C2qJyUKVvJFlnA/edit?usp=sharing).
