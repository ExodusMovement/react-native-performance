## New documentation microsite with Docusaurus üìÑ

#### October 27, 2021

Documentation is as important as the code we add to the repository, and having great documentation is crucial to provide a great developer experience.

React Native Performance used to have an excessive `README.md` covering lots of aspects of the usage of the library or explaining the internal details. However, README was not the ideal solution for documentation - it was long, and sometimes things were hard to find or could be easily overlooked.

Therefore, the team decided to invest in a dedicated [microsite built with Docusaurus](https://development.shopify.io/engineering/keytech/apidocs/microsites) to host all documentation related to React Native Performance. Microsite & Docusaurus is a standard approach to publishing information specific to the team or project at Shopify. With all app teams having their own microsites ([Shop](https://shop.docs.shopify.io/), [Inbox](https://messaging.docs.shopify.io/inbox-client-docs), [POS Next](https://pos.docs.shopify.io/)), it is a natural decision for React Native Foundations to follow the same approach.
